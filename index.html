    <p>As <span class="main">Promise Day</span> dawns upon us, 
        
         <br>Today, I want to make you a promise - a promise to stand by your side through thick and thin, 
         to support you in your dreams and aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together.

      All this might feel superficial to you and maybe not that good after whatever happened but that is okay.
     <br> I have never not put in efforts.
      THE ULRIMATE PROMISE I MAKE TO YOU IS THAT OF SELF IMPROVEMENT. IT IS A PROMISE TO YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF. 
      <br> I WILL NEVER STOP IMPROVING MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.
      <br> This is something which is incredibly uncomfortable as well as that takes a lot of time.
      <br> I am fully dedicated to that. Thats all it is. <br>
Thats the best thing I can promise you. 
       <br> Happy Promise Day, my Rove. Here's to a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless promises fulfilled.</p>

       <p><span class="main"> Your Love</span>
